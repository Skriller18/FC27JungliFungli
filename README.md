# RVDAR
For visitors, students or customers, most of the time spent in large campuses is wasted on asking staff or our residents on where a particular place is, and how one can reach there. A scheduled one hour visit can often result in a couple of hours; imbuing irritation in the hot climate and confusing shortcuts.

Our solution is RVDAR. RVDAR is a cheap, easy-to-use, self-help application which drastically reduces the time wasted trying to find locations across large campuses. Ir visually represents your path, and can provide a text-based response to get to every nook and corner of any campus in the shortest possible path. We focus on precision; not just block to block but from room to room. It is a universal solution, as the same algorithm can be used for colleges, malls, neighbourhood layouts or even in more critical situations like disaster management, or in hospitals.

We have used the A* Algorithm to find the shortest path possible. Combined with its heuristic parameter, it is a quicker search algorithm than most. We have also trained our program to recognize pathways from blueprints; and that signifies its versatility.
